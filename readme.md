This code essentially solves the diamond building by progressing top to middle and then back from middle to the bottom.

I did not use any interfaces/DI, it seemed too much of an overkill for a simple task like this.

the test coverage should be sufficient for most cases. I followed underscore principle as outlined in the spec, to make sure the diamond structure was very visible.
